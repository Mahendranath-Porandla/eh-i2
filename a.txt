8.	Study of Techniques uses for Web Based Password Capturing. 
Password cracking typically refers to the process of recovering scrambled passwords. It can be used to help a user get back a forgotten password or to help a system administrator  to check for weak passwords. But more often, password cracking is used y bad actors to gain unauthorized access to systems and resources.
Password cracking generally falls into two categories:
1.	Password guessing
2.	Password cracking.

Types of Passwords
1.	System Password (Windows password, Android lock, Bypass)

Steps for password Cracking

1.	 Now open Kali Linux and metasploitable machine.
2.	Now go Applications and scroll to password attacks. By selecting the password attacks, You can view all types of password attacks supported by KL.
3.	Now we will use hydra tool. Type the command to learn about hydra tool.
>>hydra 
4.	Open metasploitable tool, user name – msfadmin, password- msfadmin. Get IP address of metasploitable m/c by typing ifconfig.
5.	Our metasploitable m/c address is 19 2.168.56.101.
6.	Now go to Kali Linux, create a password (text file) in the desktop and type the following command
$hydra –l msfadmin –P Desktop/text.txt ftp://192.168.56.101
Next we will crack a zip file’s password 
1.	Create a text file in the desktop by right-click on desktop and select create documentempty File. 
2.	Give the filename as sample-file.txt
3.	In the terminal go to Desktop and create password protected zip file as follows.
4.	$zip sample-zip –P abc sample.txt 
5.	Type ls to view the files in the desktop. It should display the password protected zip file in the list.
6.	Create hash file as follows.
7.	$zip2john sample-zip.zip > hash1.txt
8.	It will create the hash1.txt in the desktop. We can display using cat command.
9.	With $sudo hash1.txt, we get sample.zip/sample.txt:$pkzip$1*2*2*0*1e*12*d4313f2b*0*44*0*1e*710b*c522094babf4491ef59fe9ebb3d:$pkzip$ sample.txt/sample.zip::sample.zip
10.	Open hash1.txt in nano editor and delete the contents from start and end till $.
11.	The final contents will be 
12.	$pkzip$1*2*2*0*1e*12*d4313f2b*0*44*0*1e*710b*c522094babf4491ef59fe9ebb3d:$pkzip$
13.	From here we see that it is using pkzip mode to archive.
14.	Now check the mode number with 
15.	$hashcat -help
16.	For pkzip we get
17.	17220 | PKZIP (Compressed Multi-File)                              | Archive
  17200 | PKZIP (Compressed)                                         | Archive
  17225 | PKZIP (Mixed Multi-File)                                   | Archive
  17230 | PKZIP (Mixed Multi-File Checksum-Only)                     | Archive
  17210 | PKZIP (Uncompressed)                                       | Archive
  20500 | PKZIP Master Key                                           | Archive
  20510 | PKZIP Master Key (6 byte optimization)                     | Archive

18.	Now we can crack the pwd with hashcat command. Type the hashcat command as follows. Here text in the command  in the password file. Or we can also use rockyou.txt file
$hashcat –a 0 –m  17210 hash1.txt passlist.txt
19.	-m is the mode in which password protected archived file is created.
20.	-a is the attack mode
21.	 [ Attack Modes ] -

  # | Mode
 ===+======
  0 | Straight
  1 | Combination
  3 | Brute-force
  6 | Hybrid Wordlist + Mask
  7 | Hybrid Mask + Wordlist
  9 | Association

22.	$hashcat -h for more details.
For zip files – 13600, 7-zip – 11600 and so on. We can check the mode by analysing the hash.txt file.
23.	It will give the password after $ sign in the output.
24.	We can create the archive files directly from the desktop. Right click on the file and select archive option and select the type of the archive file by clicking on the dropdown list.
25.	For 7zip we need some john-the-ripper packages. To get those type github john the ripper github in google. Go to the site and copy the link by clicking code.
26.	Create a file sample.txt and add some contents.
27.	Right click on the file – select ‘compress 1 file’ option. 
28.	Give the filename as sample.txt.7z and select the extension as 7z.
29.	Select encrypt option and give the password.
30.	Here the encrypted .7z file is generated.
31.	Go to Terminal in Desktop, clone the john-the-ripper packages as follows
32.	$git clone “https://github.com/opewall/john.git” -b bleeding-jumbo john
33.	The above will install john-the-ripper packages in john folder in desktop.
34.	Go to /john/run
35.	$ls
36.	$chmod +x 7z2john.pl
37.	$./7z2john.pl /home/geet/Desktop/sample.txt.7z>/home/geet/Desktop/hash3.txt
38.	It will create hashfile in Desktop. Open it in nano or text editor and delete till $ from beginning and type the following command in Desktop folder.
39.	$hashcat -a 0 -m 11600 hash3.txt passlist.txt

Aim::
To perform a port scanning experiment using Nmap to identify open ports on a target system and gain insight into its network security posture.
Use burpsuit to intercept the traffic between source and destination.
Requirements:
1. **Nmap**: Ensure that Nmap is installed on your system. You can download it from the official website (https://nmap.org/download.html) or install it using package managers like apt (for Linux) or Homebrew (for macOS).
2. **Target System**: Choose a target system or network to scan. Ensure that you have permission to perform the scan, as port scanning can be considered intrusive and may violate network policies or laws if conducted without authorization.

 Steps:
1. Identify the Target:
   - Determine the IP address or hostname of the target system or network you want to
       scan.

 2. Determine Scan Type:
   - Decide on the type of scan you want to perform based on your objectives and the
       level of intrusiveness allowed:
   - **TCP SYN Scan (-sS)**: Stealthy and fast scan, commonly used for initial 
          reconnaissance.
     - **TCP Connect Scan (-sT)**: Completes the TCP three-way handshake, less
            stealthy than SYN scan.
     - **UDP Scan (-sU)**: Scans for open UDP ports.
     - **Intensive Scan (-T4 or -T5)**: Faster scans, but may be more detectable.
     - **Comprehensive Scan (-A)**: Enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.
   - For this experiment, let's use the TCP SYN Scan (-sS) as it's stealthy and efficient.

 3. Execute the Scan:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Use the following command syntax to perform the TCP SYN Scan:
     ```
     nmap -sS [target]
     ```
     Replace `[target]` with the IP address or hostname of the target system.
   - Optionally, you can specify additional options to customize the scan according to 
      your requirements.

4. Analyze the Results:
   - Once the scan is complete, Nmap will provide a detailed report indicating the status 
      of each scanned port (open, closed, filtered) and may include additional information 
        such as service versions, operating system detection, and potential vulnerabilities.
   - Interpret the results to identify open ports, which could indicate services running on 
      the target system. Pay attention to any unexpected or unauthorized services that 
       may pose security risks.

5. Experiment with Additional Options:
   - Explore other Nmap options and scan types to gain a deeper understanding of 
      network reconnaissance techniques.
   - Experiment with different timing options (-T), output formats (-oA, -oX, -oG), and 
       script scanning (--script) to tailor the scan to your specific requirements.

6. Documentation and Reporting:
   - Document the scan parameters, results, and any observations or insights gained 
     during the experiment.
   - Prepare a comprehensive report summarizing the findings, including 
      recommendations for mitigating any identified security vulnerabilities or risks.


By following these steps, you can conduct a thorough port scanning experiment using Nmap to assess the security posture of a target system or network. Remember to approach the experiment responsibly and ethically, respecting the privacy and integrity of the target infrastructure.
